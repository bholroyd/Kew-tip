`theme=kew-tip-<timestamp>`

Themes can also be set in kew itself. `t` cycles through themes `F6` shows the help page and the current theme. This selection is then stored in `~/.local/state/kewstaterc.`

Kew-tip has been tested against version 3.7 of kew, and its possible that it behaves slightly differently and generates different options to those available on different versions.
